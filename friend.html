                <p>After the whole review, if you are still having issue understanding HTML, <br> there will be videos
                    and links

            <h2>Let me take you through on what have been taught on HTML</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="means">
                <P>HTML is basically the structural work of every webpage. what do i mean by that?</P>
                <p> HTML means (Hypertext Makeup Language).It is like the skeleton in your body <br> and every other
                    thing
                    are
                    one it. or it like a new constructed house that has not been roof, plaster <br> or been painted.All
                    you
                    will
                    see is the pillars and bricks. That's basically HTML in comparison</p>
            </div>
            <H2>Let go further into HTML </H2>
            <div class="just">
                <p>we dont just write HTML-code on any application or file, you have to <br> make use of a code editor
                    like:
                    v.s
                    code (visual studio code), <br> and you will need to install it into your window. <br>
                    After that you have to open a file in your vscode, you can name it <br> anything you want but always
                    remember
                    to input ". html" e.g(index.html) <br> so that you browser knows that you are about to write html
                    code. </p>
                <p>In vs code, the simplest way to get your HTML DOCTYPE, is by pressing (shift + !), <br> that will
                    popup the
                    head with everthing you need</p>
